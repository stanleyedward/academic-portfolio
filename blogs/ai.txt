1. AI artist
2. seperating the art from the artist -i love you from different people is different, kanye example
3. the art is what the artist intended it to be, not your interpretation, there is no meaning, soul, or culture in the art without the artist
3. studio ghibli AI art: 1y3m to animate 4 seconds - 
4. math is a lagnuage, research is art, language is art :you start with the rules- as you get better you dissect it, create slangs, doesnt make you wrong
5. old programming/ low level is art: javascript is not.
6.javascript would kill my improvement as a programmer, selling coffee at google would be a better for my future programming career than doing webdev/js and just glueing shit together learnign nothing, doing nothing challenging.
7. vide coder are the same as ai artists: different sides o the same coin, vide coders better not say they "built anything" it was stolen by the people who took the effort to build and regurgitated by the language model.
9. vibe coders saying they "bbuild" this project is like, an AI artist saying they "make" art.
8. vide coders dont build anything new, they assemble. there is a difference.
