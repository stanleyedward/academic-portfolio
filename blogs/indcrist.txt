1. most the indcrist are from lowercaste of india the dalits and adhivasis
2. converted for spiritual and socal liberation
3. uppercaste says "they got manipulated" like we dont have slef-agency or cant think for ourselves.
4. "just for a bag of rice", yea coz they are neglected in your system
5. the upper dont care about the lower, they always seclude them, they dont wanna associate with them, to the point where they arent even allowed in the religious places.
6. the only time they care about hindu unity is when the lower caste is shrinking, they say indcrist is a threat to hindu.
7. its not a threat to hindu but a threat to your upper hegemony.
8. they know without the lowercaste the uppercaste doesnt exist.
11. its like mens rights activism, they never bring up mens issues, until someone brings up womens rights or womens day(8th march), i can tell you for a fact they dont even know when its mens day (19th nov), most the issues men face are caused my other men.
9. ive overheard many dudes while walking down the stairs of my college.
	- saying girls just get shortlisted coz theyre girls, in hackathons they call them PPT makers. They generalize and undervalue every woman. they cannot believe a woman can have technical prowess. Even my future flatmates, they mock and doubt my labs syndicate saying "does she even have any skill?" while they refuse to even talk to her or get to know her better. They have biases they refuse to confirm because that fits their narrative.
	 
12. i also know people by name (name rhymes with brinda anghuta)in uni that have verbally expressed their distain for converted christians in india.
13. i know peoplein my uni who have expressed hatred towards south indians, anti-dark skin sentiments, this could be made into its blog, since i have also had to deal with these, not only in university but for as long as i have lived in india, definitely had affected my childhood is some sort of way, this could be yet another blog lmao.
